# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 🎄

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code
2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024), my fourth year of participation.

## What Is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a series of small programming
puzzles created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). Every day from December 1st to
25th, a puzzle is released alongside an engaging fictional Christmas story. Each
puzzle consists of two parts, the second of which usually contains some
interesting twist or changing requirements and is only unlocked after completing
the first one. The objective is to solve all parts and collect fifty stars ⭐
until December 25th to save Christmas.

Many users compete on the [global
leaderboard](https://adventofcode.com/2024/leaderboard) by solving the puzzles
in an unbelievably fast way in order to get some extra points. Personally, I see
Advent of Code as a fun exercise to do during the Advent season while waiting
for Christmas. I often use it to learn a new programming language (like I did in
2021 with `C#`) or some advanced programming concepts. I can only encourage you
to participate as well – of course in a way that you find fun. Just get started
and learn more about Advent of Code [here](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about).

## About This Project

For this year of Advent of Code, I decided to go with `C++`. In the previous
year, I had a lot of fun solving the puzzles in `C` and implementing my own
small utility library called [`SCU`](https://github.com/Piwimau/SCU) alongside.
It was a great opportunity to improve my systems programming skills, and I also
enjoyed the challenge of working with a rather low-level language. However, I
have always been interested in `C++` as well, but felt a bit intimidated by its
complexity (or at least how complex it is often portrayed to be). This year, I
finally decided to give it a try and see how it compares to `C`, especially in
terms of development speed, the improved type safety and advanced language
features like templates, operator overloading or RAII, which I sometimes miss
when working with `C`.

For this project and in general when developing software, I strive to produce
readable and well-documented source code. However, I also enjoy benchmarking and
optimizing my code, which is why I sometimes implement a less idiomatic, yet
more efficient solution at the expense of readability. In such situations, I try
to document my design choices with analogies, possible alternative solutions and
sometimes little sketches to better illustrate the way a piece of code works.

The general structure of this project is as follows:

```plaintext
Day-01-Historian-Hysteria/
  resources/
    .gitkeep
  src/
    main.cpp
Day-02-Red-Nosed-Reports/

    main.cpp
...

```

The repository contains 25 standalone projects for the days of the Advent
calendar, organized into separate directories. Each one provides a `src`
directory with a `main.cpp` file in which the execution begins. In addition,
there is a `resources` directory which contains the puzzle description and my
personal input for that day. However, [as
requested](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about) by the creator of Advent of
Code, these are only present in my own private copy of the repository and
therefore not publicly available.

> If you're posting a code repository somewhere, please don't include parts of
> Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs.

As a consequence, you will have to provide your own inputs for the days, as
described in more detail in the following section.

## Dependencies and Usage

If you want to try out one of my solutions, simply follow these steps below:

1. Ensure you have a compiler supporting the `C++23` standard (such as `GCC`,
   `Clang` or `MSVC`) installed on your machine.

2. Clone the repository (or download the source code) to a directory of your
   choice.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Piwimau/Advent-of-Code-2024 ./Advent-of-Code-2024
   cd ./Advent-of-Code-2024
   ```

3. Once you have downloaded the source code, run `make help` to get an overview
   of the available targets and variables. This should output something like
   this:

   ```plaintext
   Usage: make [TARGET]... [VARIABLE]...

   Targets:
     all    Build the selected day (default).
     run    Build and run the selected day.
     clean  Remove all build artifacts of the selected day.
     help   Display this help and exit.

   Variables:
     CONFIG={debug|release}  Set the build configuration (default: debug).
     DAY=N                   Select the day by its two-digit number N (default: first day found).
     NATIVE=1                Enable machine-specific optimizations.
     V                       Enable verbose build output.
   ```

   To build the solution for a specific day, run `make all` (or simply `make`)
   and specify the day by its two-digit number.

    ```shell
    make DAY=01
    ```

    If you don't specify a day, the directory of the first day in the repository
    will be selected by default. Note that `make all` produces an unoptimized
    debug build by default. Optionally specify `CONFIG=release` and `NATIVE=1`
    to enable (machine-specific) optimizations.

    ```shell
    make DAY=01 CONFIG=release NATIVE=1
    ```

4. To run the solution for a specific day, use `make run`, which will build the
   solution (if not done already) and execute it.

   ```shell
   make run DAY=01 CONFIG=release NATIVE=1
   ```

   Note that the solutions read the puzzle input from the standard input stream.
   The `run` target expects a file called `input.txt` in the `resources`
   directory of the selected day, which is used to redirect the standard input
   stream. [As explained above](#about-this-project), my input files are not
   included in the repository, so you'll have to create them yourself and paste
   your puzzle input into them. You can find your input for each day
   [here](https://adventofcode.com/2024) if you haven't downloaded it already.

## Timings

Finally, here are some simple (non-scientific) timings I created using
`std::chrono::high_resolution_clock` and my main machine (Intel Core i9-13900HX,
32GB DDR5-5600 RAM) running Windows 11 25H2. All used `CONFIG=release` and
`NATIVE=1` to take advantage of (machine-specific) optimizations. The reported
times are the result of ten runs and represent the (real) wall time, including
the time spent for parsing the input, as well as printing the puzzle results.

| Day                        |      Min |      Max |     Mean |   Median | Standard Deviation |
|----------------------------|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|-------------------:|
| Day 1 – Historian Hysteria | 1.290 ms | 1.588 ms | 1.399 ms | 1.374 ms |           0.104 ms |
| Day 2 – Red-Nosed Reports  | 1.982 ms | 2.455 ms | 2.260 ms | 2.283 ms |           0.138 ms |
| Day 3 – Mull It Over       | 2.593 ms | 3.051 ms | 2.771 ms | 2.756 ms |           0.136 ms |
| Day 4 – Ceres Search       | 1.454 ms | 1.891 ms | 1.689 ms | 1.716 ms |           0.148 ms |
| Total                      | 7.319 ms | 8.985 ms | 8.119 ms | 8.129 ms |           0.526 ms |
